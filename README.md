Milestone Project 1 by Rachel Heywood 28/06/2019

This is a website designed to showcase the music of the 1960's rock band "The
Monkees" to existing and potential fans. It advertises that the band are
avaliable for private events, it has information on upcoming gigs and has links
all over the web to increase sales and social media presence.

The website has been created on AWS Cloud9 using HTML, CSS and minimal
Javascript with the help of the framwork provided by Bootstrap and using Github
as a repository and to deploy the live project.

As this was my first almost fully functoning website I believe there are a few
problems with the initial code which the entire site has been built arround,
with more time I would like to smooth out the problems this had created making
the site more aesthetically pleasing. Also with further Javascript knowledge
the functions of the website (booking events, signing up for newsletters etc.)
would ideally be taken further.
