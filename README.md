Milestone Project 1 by Rachel Heywood 28/06/2019

This is a website designed to showcase the music of the 1960's rock band "The
Monkees" to existing and potential fans. It advertises that the band are
avaliable for private events, it has information on upcoming gigs and has links
all over the web to increase sales and social media presence.

The website has been created on Cloud9/AWS Cloud9 using HTML, CSS and minimal
Javascript with the help of the framwork provided by Bootstrap and JQuery also
using Github as a repository and to deploy the live project.

Unfortunately when starting this project I was not familiar with the most recent
responsive display utility classes on Bootstrap so made the mistake of making
the pages responsive towards the end of the project, I believe this may have
made changing the layout more difficult. Also with further Javascript knowledge
the functions of the website (booking events, signing up for newsletters etc.)
would ideally be taken further.

When migrating from cloud9 to aws cloud9 "git push" would not work and resulted
the use of a new repository meaning the first 33 commits are not shown on this
repository but can be found here:
